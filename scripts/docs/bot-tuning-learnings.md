# Bot Tuning Learnings

Purpose: This document records accepted and rejected bot-tuning routes so future iterations do not repeat already falsified hypotheses without new evidence.

## 2026-08-22: Paired-Board Private-Pair Calls

### Accepted: Formal Two Pair Is Not Always Strong Private Value

- **Pattern:** On paired boards, the formal `Two Pair` label merged strategically different hands. A lower private board pair or a pocket pair below the board singletons was defended almost like a top private board pair or a pocket pair above the singletons.
- **Route:** Keep the shared postflop risk line, but evaluate weak paired-board private-pair calls from their public-board strength plus limited private contribution. Leave raise/value logic and stronger neighboring hand families unchanged.
- **Result:** Accepted. The candidate removes weak bluffcatching calls instead of reducing the whole defense range or adding an MDF exception.
- **Evidence:** In the 1000-run acceptance batch, lower private-pair calls fell from `80.5%` to `69.7%` and pocket-under calls from `83.1%` to `70.2%`. Top private-pair calls stayed stable at `82.2%` to `81.7%`, while pocket-over calls stayed stable at `80.2%` to `81.5%`.
- **Equity:** The targeted 300-run equity check reduced paired-board private-pair calls from `954` to `852`; low-equity calls fell from about `642` to `548`, and their share from `67.3%` to `64.3%`.
- **Keep:** Separate nominal hand rank from the private contribution that actually makes the hand playable. Protect top private pairs, pocket pairs above the board singletons, genuine unpaired-board two pair, trips+, and real draws.
- **Do not repeat blindly:** Do not tighten all paired-board calls, weaken all two-pair hands, or chase MDF by adding trash calls. Use board shape, private contribution, price, and pressure together.
- **Watchpoint:** Weak paired-board calls still contain a high low-equity share. Treat that as a future diagnosis trigger only if a fresh report shows a stable remaining cluster; do not stack another broad penalty onto this accepted route.

### Validation Snapshot

- **Comparison baseline:** `tmp/v150-multiraise-realization-acceptance-20260815-1000`
- **Accepted core batch:** `tmp/poker-engine-batch-20260822-135113`
- **Accepted equity batch:** `tmp/poker-engine-batch-20260822-135453`
- **Hard guardrails:** premium preflop folds `0`, bluff raises with made hand `0`, all-in low-edge reraises `0`.
- **Global defense:** Facing-bet MDF overfold changed only marginally from `13.33%` to `13.54%`; the global postflop action mix stayed stable.

## 2026-08-22: Multi-Raised Call Realization

### Accepted: Narrower Entry Without Sacrificing Playability

- **Pattern:** Bots carried too many fragile hands through additional preflop raises, then reached postflop with ranges that were wider but difficult to realize.
- **Route:** Reuse the central preflop realization model for multi-raised calls so suitedness, connectivity, pair type, domination risk, position, and pressure decide which speculative hands continue.
- **Result:** Accepted. The candidate trims weak multi-raised entries instead of forcing broader defense for MDF.
- **Evidence:** In the 1000-run acceptance batch, flop facing-bet spots after a final `callVsMultiRaise` route fell from `1278` to `1134`, while their fold rate improved from `55.1%` to `53.4%`. The surviving range is smaller but slightly more capable of continuing.
- **Keep:** Treat range width and playability as separate concerns. Preserve suited, connected, paired, and otherwise realizable hands; do not preserve weak entries only to increase raw defense frequency.
- **Do not repeat blindly:** Do not repair multi-raised ranges with combo lists or MDF call overrides. Tune the shared realization inputs and validate the resulting range composition.
- **Watchpoint:** The targeted equity pass exposed a separate postflop classification issue around apparent two-pair value on paired boards. It is not part of this accepted preflop candidate and should not be folded into it without a separate decision.

## 2026-06-15: Structural Made-Hand Call Relief

### Rejected: Narrow Relief Was Too Small To Ship

- **Pattern:** Bots folded some real private two-pair and trips improvements just below the postflop risk line when facing raises.
- **Route tested:** A narrow call-barrier relief for structural private made-hand lifts, with river relief limited to very cheap calls.
- **Result:** Rejected after validation. The candidate stayed safe, but the behavior gain was too small for another local risk-line exception.
- **Evidence:** The final 1000-engine batch kept hard guardrails clean and moved the target fold rate from the comparison baseline `9.43%` to `8.68%`; the direct 500-run candidate moved it to `8.36%`.
- **Scale:** The candidate rescued roughly `60-90` narrow spots per 1000 games, about `0.07%` of all hands in the acceptance run.
- **MDF impact:** Global facing-bet overfold stayed effectively unchanged (`13.32%` comparison gap, `12.97%` direct 500-run candidate gap, `13.21%` final 1000-run candidate gap). Treat this as a made-hand coherence symptom, not an MDF fix.
- **Architecture reason:** The relief was defensible in isolation, but it added another special call-barrier adjustment for a very small slice of all hands. The risk line already has several local adjustments, so more narrow reliefs increase model drift and make future behavior harder to explain.
- **Do not repeat blindly:** Do not add more narrow `...CallRelief()` helpers for adjacent symptoms. The effect is small, and repeated reliefs will make the risk-line model harder to reason about.
- **Next better route:** If similar postflop symptoms appear again, integrate them into a central postflop range-quality / risk-line model instead of adding another local exception.

## 2026-06-15: General Preflop Realization Model

### Accepted: Hand Shape Instead of a Mini-Range Rule

- **Pattern:** The first fix improved weak short-handed offsuit limps, but `isDecentShortHandedOffsuitJunk()` was too close to a mini starting-hand list.
- **Route:** Replace the special case with `getPreflopRealizationPenalty()`, which accounts for hand family, suitedness, connectivity, domination risk, position, active players, and route.
- **Evidence:** The accepted 1000-engine batch keeps preflop mix, showdown/uncontested, SB-HU, BTN-3, and hard guardrails stable. It slightly reduces BTN-3 limps, while low connected offsuit hands become limpable from SB-HU more often than under the previous special-case helper.
- **Keep:** Future preflop realization tuning should go into this model, not into new hand-list-like special helpers.
- **Do not repeat blindly:** Do not rescue or cut individual combos when connectivity, suitedness, domination, and route can explain the decision more generally.
- **Data-shape guardrail:** If `getPreflopRealizationPenalty()` is called with `preflopScores` instead of the full profile, `dominationRisk`, `suited`, `pair`, and `connector` must exist on the score object; otherwise pressure becomes `NaN` and eligibility is distorted.

### Validation Snapshot: Preflop Realization Model

- **Accepted comparison batch:** `tmp/poker-engine-batch-20260615-114336`
- **Accepted model batch:** `tmp/poker-engine-batch-20260615-124334`
- **Hard guardrails:** premium preflop folds `0`, bluff raises with made hand `0`, all-in low-edge reraises `0`.
- **Global mix:** preflop fold/call/raise `64.4%/15.7%/17.8%` comparison vs `64.0%/16.0%/17.8%` model; showdown/uncontested `20.2%/79.8%` comparison vs `20.6%/79.4%` model.
- **Short-handed open action:** SB-HU open uncontested `63.3%` comparison vs `62.6%` model; BTN-3 folded-through `43.0%` comparison vs `42.9%` model.
- **Passive limp profile:** SB-HU limps `52.42` -> `57.89` per 1000 hands; BTN-3 limps `29.23` -> `28.94` per 1000 hands. The SB-HU increase is accepted because global action, defend dynamics, and trash guardrails stayed stable.
- **Connector watchpoint resolved:** In protected short-handed unopened limp spots, `98o` moved from `1.84` to `4.13` per 1000 hands, `87o` from `0.00` to `2.15`, and `76o` from `0.00` to `1.99`.
- **Trash guardrail:** Clearly weak disconnected offsuit hands such as `T4o`, `94o`, `83o`, and `72o` stayed at `100.0%` folds in the same protected short-handed unopened sample.

## 2026-06-14: Formula-Based Unopened Preflop Range Policy

### Accepted: Fix Unopened Preflop Leaks With a Range Policy, Not Hand Rescues

- **Pattern:** AJo cutoff/4 exposed a broader unopened-preflop range-shape problem, not just a bad single-hand threshold.
- **Route:** Use formula-based context signals for range openness, limp permission, realization demand, domination demand, and implied-odds credit.
- **Evidence:** The final 1000-engine batch kept global action stable while improving targeted hand-family behavior.
- **Keep:** Tune unopened-preflop decisions through seat, active-player count, stack pressure, hand family, score margin, and playability pressure.
- **Do not repeat blindly:** Do not add concrete starting-hand lists or special-case rescues for a single combo when a family/context formula can explain the spot.

### Accepted: A Stable Global Mix Matters More Than One Perfect Target Rate

- **Pattern:** The accepted candidate slightly undershot the old AJo cutoff/4 target lower bound, but preserved the wider system.
- **Route:** Accept a near-boundary target if broader guardrails and adjacent clusters are cleaner than the alternative.
- **Evidence:** AJo cutoff/4 moved from `38.8%` fold to `14.8%`; AJo early/6 moved from `71.6%` to `52.6%`; UO fold rate stayed stable at `68.0%` baseline vs `68.3%` final.
- **Keep:** Prefer small target drift when the overall preflop and postflop mix remains coherent.
- **Do not repeat blindly:** Do not chase a narrow target band if doing so reintroduces global looseness or early-position over-entry.

### Accepted: Early-Position Pair and Broadway Discipline Must Survive Late-Position Fixes

- **Pattern:** A fix that rescues late-position playable hands can accidentally over-open early-position medium hands and small pairs.
- **Route:** Compare the same hand families across cutoff/4, early/5, and early/6 before accepting.
- **Evidence:** Final small pairs cutoff/4 improved from `49.0%` fold to `6.9%`, while small pairs early/6 stayed selective at `58.7%`. KQo early/6 improved from `73.1%` to `49.4%` instead of collapsing to `0.0%`.
- **Keep:** Let implied-odds credit help small pairs in suitable multiway/late spots, but keep realization and domination pressure active in early seats.
- **Do not repeat blindly:** Do not remove early-position friction just because the same family is underplayed in late position.

### Rejected: The Broad AJo Symptom Patch

- **Hypothesis:** Lowering open thresholds and allowing broad limp fallbacks is enough to fix AJo and related folds.
- **Result:** Rejected as too loose.
- **Why:** It improved AJo but over-corrected adjacent clusters: KQo early/6 reached `0.0%` folds and small pairs early/6 reached `3.5%` folds.
- **Allowed again only if:** A future patch proves the broader range mix stays stable across early-position broadways, small pairs, UO rates, and postflop guardrails.

### Validation Snapshot

- **Baseline batch:** `/private/tmp/poker-baseline-compare.KMqkKi/tmp/poker-engine-batch-20260614-195549`
- **Rejected symptom batch:** `tmp/poker-engine-batch-20260614-194645`
- **Accepted final batch:** `tmp/poker-engine-batch-20260614-204143`
- **Hard guardrails:** premium preflop folds `0`, protective folds `0`, favorite strong-hand folds `0`, all-in low-edge reraises `0`.
- **Global mix:** showdown rate `20.6%` baseline vs `20.7%` final; decisions per hand `5.1` unchanged; champion spread improved from `47` to `26`.
- **Watchpoint:** `postflop.reraises.lowEdgeCount` moved from `26` to `32`; examples were value-heavy two-pair reraises, so this is not a rejection signal unless it clusters with weaker hand quality later.

## 2026-05-13: More Active Tournament Play

### Accepted: Short-Handed Action Is a Primary Engine

- **Pattern:** SB-HU and BTN-3 should be tuned as action engines, not as ordinary full-ring spots.
- **Route:** Open and defend activity can be increased when runtime signals show short-handed position, playable hand shape, and manageable stack risk.
- **Evidence:** The accepted direction moved bots away from waiting for premiums while keeping premium-fold and made-hand bluff-raise guardrails clean.
- **Keep:** Future iterations may keep tuning short-handed action if they preserve discipline in early, OOP, multiway, and high-commitment spots.
- **Do not repeat blindly:** Do not globally loosen all preflop thresholds to fix a short-handed leak.

### Accepted: Marginal Blind Defense Needs Seat-Aware Discipline

- **Pattern:** High combined BTN-3 blind defense is not automatically a leak because two blinds can defend.
- **Route:** Look separately at SB defend, BB defend, both-blinds-defend, and second-blind entries.
- **Evidence:** The useful pressure point was not "BTN-3 defense is high" in isolation, but whether weak second-blind or SB entries created poor arrival and bust pressure.
- **Keep:** Trim dominated or low-realization blind defenses by seat, price, and role instead of cutting all blind defense.
- **Do not repeat blindly:** Do not treat combined blind-defense percentage as a standalone fail.

### Accepted: Equity Belongs in Diagnostics, Not Runtime Decisions

- **Pattern:** Equity vs estimated ranges is useful for diagnosis and acceptance, especially for call quality, high-equity folds, low-equity calls, and arrival quality.
- **Route:** Use equity batches to identify clusters, then translate findings into runtime proxies already available to `js/bot.js`.
- **Evidence:** Equity signals made decision quality easier to inspect without turning the bot into a clean solver-like agent.
- **Keep:** Compare equity to pot odds in analysis, but tune with hand class, position, route, price, stack pressure, and realization proxies.
- **Do not repeat blindly:** Do not add `equityPct` or `equityRank` as direct bot action inputs.

### Accepted: Early Busts Require Context

- **Pattern:** Short tournaments and early busts are not failures by themselves in winner-take-all play.
- **Route:** Judge busts by hand class, zone, position, action sequence, price/equity signal, and avoidable stack risk.
- **Evidence:** Some all-ins below trips were explainable by short-stack pressure, price, or credible made-hand/draw context.
- **Keep:** Flag clustered weak-quality busts, not every early elimination.
- **Do not repeat blindly:** Do not make early-bust count or `allInBelowTrips` a hard fail without context.

### Accepted: Analysis Must Distinguish False Fails From Real Leaks

- **Pattern:** A metric that catches risk can still be too blunt for acceptance.
- **Route:** Refine analysis so explainable cases are classified instead of forcing the bot to avoid them.
- **Evidence:** The better fix was to sharpen diagnostics around all-in and bust context, not to add broad runtime fear.
- **Keep:** Improve analysis when the metric is less precise than the poker situation.
- **Do not repeat blindly:** Do not add runtime guards just to satisfy an over-broad fail metric.

### Rejected: Fixing MDF by Adding Broad Weak Calls

- **Hypothesis:** More calls can repair overfold or MDF deficits.
- **Result:** Rejected as a general route.
- **Why:** Defense must come from plausible range-relevant hands, not trash calls made to fill frequency.
- **Allowed again only if:** Backtrace shows enough defendable hands arrive in the spot and fold despite good price, position, and hand quality.

### Rejected: Treating Shorter Tournaments as Inherently Worse

- **Hypothesis:** A candidate is worse if tournaments get shorter.
- **Result:** Rejected as a standalone criterion.
- **Why:** Winner-take-all play should allow pressure, busts, and shorter runs when action is strategically plausible.
- **Allowed again only if:** Shorter length comes with clustered weak hand quality, poor price, bad position, unnecessary stack risk, or guardrail regression.

### Rejected: Aggregate-Only Opponent or Table Metrics as Tuning Proof

- **Hypothesis:** A table-level aggregate is enough to justify a broad threshold change.
- **Result:** Rejected as too coarse.
- **Why:** Aggregates can hide seat, route, hand-family, and second-blind problems.
- **Allowed again only if:** The aggregate is backed by route/position/hand-class breakdowns and representative examples.

### Rejected: Directly Optimizing One Public Metric

- **Hypothesis:** Improve the obvious red metric first and accept if it moves.
- **Result:** Rejected as a tuning method.
- **Why:** Single metrics can improve by moving damage into another street, route, or hand family.
- **Allowed again only if:** Related metrics, guardrails, and equity/backtrace diagnostics support the same cause.
