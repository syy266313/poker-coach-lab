/*
Version log writing guide:
- Write from the player's or game's point of view, not from the code's point of view.
- Describe functional behavior and gameplay impact instead of internal helpers, tags, thresholds, or refactors.
- Keep titles short, plain-language, and feature-oriented.
- Keep notes concise and focused on what changed in play, pacing, risk, or clarity.
- Do not mention log, speedmode, or internal diagnostics changes in public version entries.
- Keep internal batch or output-location changes out of the public version log.
- Group related tuning work into one coherent entry instead of listing every small internal step.
- Add optional contributor credits as dedicated metadata instead of release notes.
